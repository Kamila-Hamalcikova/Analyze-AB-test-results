# Analyze A/B Test Results for new design of website

This is a study project for practice of A/B testing for students of [Data Analyst](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) nanodegree by Udacity. Statistical testing and logistic regression were performed in order to decide if company should implement new design of website or keep the old website as it is.

### Instalation

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.6
- Anaconda

### Methods used

- data analysis with Pandas
- hypothesis testing, logistic regression

### Conclusion

Null hypothesis stated that conversion rate for old design of website is better or same as new design. Based on not statistically significant results (p-value was too high) from both hypothesis testing and logistic regression I had to keep null hypothesis. In other words, I would not recommend implementation of new design of the website.
